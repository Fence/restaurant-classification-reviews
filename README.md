# Classification of Restaurants from Customer Reviews
** TO BE UPDATED**
Classification of Restaurants from Customer Reviews in Yelp Dataset
Currently, classification of restaurants is done by what restaurants say
We should be able to classify a restaurant based on customer reviews
A restaurant may be American by classification but people mostly like it for its Noodles
- thus its Chinese as per the customer reviews
Cheesecake factory serves amazing Pasta but classified as Desserts - should be classified as
Italian as well
